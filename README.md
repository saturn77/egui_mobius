egui_mobius is a comprehensive application framework built on egui that transforms its immediate mode foundation into a complete development platform. It combines reactive state management, thread-safe async operations, and a powerful component system to create rich, responsive applications with clean architecture.

# Core Features

The egui_mobius ecosystem provides multiple paradigms for building modern GUI applications, each serving different needs while maintaining compatibility with one another:

## üìä Reactive State Management
- Thread-safe reactive primitives via `Dynamic<T>` and `Derived<T>` 
- Automatic UI updates when state changes
- Efficient dependency tracking with minimal boilerplate
- Composition-friendly design patterns with `ReactiveWidgetRef`

## üß© Component Library
- Reusable, composable UI components in `egui_mobius_components`
- Advanced event logging with our EventLogger component
- Customizable widgets with integrated reactive state
- Consistent design patterns across your application

## ‚ö° Async Runtime
- Background processing that keeps your UI responsive
- Type-safe message passing between threads
- Built on Tokio for reliable async operations
- Seamless integration with the reactive system

## üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture
- Signal-slot system for clean separation of UI and business logic
- `MobiusWidget` traits for encapsulated, reusable UI elements
- Scalable patterns for complex applications
- Stateful components that maintain their own lifecycle

# Ecosystem

The egui_mobius framework consists of multiple coordinated crates:

- `egui_mobius`: Core signal-slot and dispatching system
- `egui_mobius_reactive`: Thread-safe reactive state management
- `egui_mobius_widgets`: Custom, stateful widget implementations
- `egui_mobius_components`: Higher-level UI components

# Getting Started

Explore our comprehensive examples to understand different architectural approaches:

- `clock_reactive`: Modern reactive UI with minimal boilerplate
- `clock_async`: Thread-aware async operations with clean UI feedback
- `reactive_slider`: ReactiveWidgetRef for retained-mode style composition
- `logger_component`: EventLogger component for sophisticated event tracking

For the fastest start, check out our [template repository](https://github.com/saturn77/egui_mobius_template):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saturn77/egui_mobius_template.git
cd egui_mobius_template
```

The template provides three comprehensive examples:

* **Reactive** - Basic reactive UI demo showing fundamental state management
* **Reactive-Async** - Sophisticated async task handling with background operations
* **Signals-Slots** - Full-featured RLC Circuit Simulator demonstrating signal-slot architecture
