The egui_mobius library is designed to integrate the egui GUI library with the Mobius framework, enabling efficient and responsive user interfaces by leveraging Mobius's signal-slot mechanism for message passing and state management. Here are some key points about its design architecture:

## Key Components

1. Signals and Slots
    
    **Signals** send messages or events from one part of the application to another, using a channel / queue. 

    **Slots** act as receivers for signals, processing the received messages or events on the other end of the channel. Slots alsoo spin
    up their own thread, which is mentioned in more detail in the [Signals & Slots](signals_slots.md) section. 

2. Data Types

    A **Value<T>** is a thread-safe wrapper around shared data, allowing safe concurrent access and modification.


    An **Edge<T>** Represents a value that can change over time, with methods to track changes.

3. Event Types

    Custom event types are defined to represent different kinds of messages or commands that can be sent between the UI and backend.


    ```rust
    // Define event types
    #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
    enum EventType {
        Foo { id: usize, message: String },
        Bar { id: usize, message: String },
        // Other event types...
    }

    // Define processed event types
    #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
    enum ProcessedType {
        Foo { id: usize, message: String },
        Bar { id: usize, message: String },
        // Other processed event types...
    }
    ```

## Design Principles
1. Separation of Concerns

    The UI and backend logic are separated, with the UI sending events to the backend and the backend processing these events and sending updates back to the UI. This facilitates a command architecture design
    pattern of 
    - main.rs - declare signals,slots, `backend_consumer_thread`
    - ui_app.rs - holds `UiApp` & `impl eframe::App for UiApp`
    - backend.rs - holds `fn backend_consumer_thread`

2. Thread Safety

    Shared data is wrapped in thread-safe types (`Value<T>`, `Edge<T>`) to ensure safe concurrent access.

3. Reactive Updates

    The UI updates reactively based on events received from the backend, ensuring efficient and responsive interfaces.

## Example Workflow
1. UI Interaction:

    The user interacts with the UI, triggering events (e.g., button clicks, slider changes).

2. Event Handling:

    These events are sent as signals to the backend for processing.

3. Backend Processing:

    The backend processes the events, updates the shared state, and sends processed events back to the UI.

4. UI Update:

    The UI receives the processed events and updates the interface accordingly.

    ```rust
    // UI Application struct
    struct UiApp {
        logger_text: Value<String>,
        signal_to_backend: Signal<EventType>,
        slot_on_uiapp: Slot<ProcessedType>,
        update_needed: Value<bool>,
        // Other fields...
    }

    // Implement eframe::App for UiApp
    impl eframe::App for UiApp {
        fn update(&mut self, ctx: &egui::Context, _frame: &mut eframe::Frame) {
            // UI update logic...
        }
    }

    // Backend consumer thread
    fn backend_consumer_thread(
        logger_text: Value<String>,
        messages: Value<VecDeque<String>>,
        update_needed: Value<bool>,
        mut slot: Slot<EventType>,
        slot_on_uiapp: Signal<ProcessedType>,
    ) {
        slot.start({
            let messages_clone = Value::clone(&messages);
            let update_needed_clone = Value::clone(&update_needed);
            let logger_text_clone = Value::clone(&logger_text);
            move |event| {
                // Event processing logic...
            }
        });
    }

    // Main function
    fn main() {
        // Initialization and setup...
    }
    ```
