# Signals Slots Example

The `signals_slots` shows how to use the factory method along with signals and slots to setup channel communications in egui_mobius. 

# Features

example demonstrates how to:

- Implement a signal-slot mechanism using the `mobius_egui` library.
- Define and use `Signal` structs to send commands asynchronously.
- Define and use `Slot` structs to receive and handle commands.
- Showcase the interaction between frontend and backend using signals and slots.
- Illustrate how to handle multiple commands and process them in a separate thread.
- Provide a clear and concise way to manage asynchronous communication in a Rust application, similar to Qt's signal-slot mechanism.

This example helps you understand how to set up and use the signal-slot pattern in your `mobius_egui` applications, enabling efficient and organized communication between different parts of your application.
