// General Notes:
// A relatively simple, but yet very important, example of using signals and slots
// to communicate between different parts of a program.
// This example demonstrates how to create a signal and slot pair using the factory function,
// and how to send commands from the signal to the slot.
// The slot is started with a handler function that will process the commands sent from the signal.
// The commands are sent using the send and send_multiple methods of the signal.
// The handler function simply prints the received commands to the console.
// The example also includes a delay to give some time for the commands to be processed.



fn main() {
    // Create a signal and slot via the egui_mobius factory function
    let (signal, mut slot) = factory::create_signal_slot::<String>(1);

    let shutdown_flag: Arc<AtomicBool> = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
    
    // Start the slot with a handler
    // Note : since the handler takes Fn() as input, it can be a closure or a function
    // The handler function will be called whenever a command is sent to the slot, but the 
    // caller of the handler function is the slot itself.
    // here we use a closure due to needing a clone of the shutdown flag.
    slot.start({
        // clone the flag for the scope of the handler, which is moved into the closure below
        let shutdown_flag = shutdown_flag.clone();

        // Define a handler closure for the slot
        move |command: String| {
            println!("Handled command: {}", command);

            if command.contains("shutdown") {
                shutdown_flag.clone().store(true, Ordering::Relaxed)
            }
        }

    // Send a single command
    if let Err(e) = signal.send("Command 1".to_string()) {
        eprintln!("Error sending command: {}", e);

    }

    if let Err(e) = signal.send("shutdown".to_string()) {
        eprintln!("Error sending shutdown command: {}", e);
    }

    // Wait for the shutdown flag to be set.
    // Note: there are other ways to achieve this without manual polling, such as using `CondVar` from the 'parking_lot' crate 
    //       See https://docs.rs/parking_lot/latest/parking_lot/struct.Condvar.html
